## Dev Assistant Build

This document outlines the architecture and behavior of the **Developer Assistant**, a tool designed to support engineering workflows by analyzing codebases, generating assistants, and executing dev-related actions.

---

### Purpose

- Analyze and index codebases
- Automatically generate assistant scaffolding
- Answer development-related questions (e.g., commands, TODOs, structure)

---

### Structure

- `personal-assistants/assistant-development/assistant.js` — Assistant logic
- `config.json` — Role definition, skills, intent categories
- Integrates with `ai-architect-core` orchestrator

---

### Core Features

- Codebase scanning and file indexing
- Assistant auto-generation logic
- Redis-powered memory layers
- MongoDB for DevNote access and snapshots
- Intelligent response building with project context

---

### Example Prompts

- “What commands are available?”
- “Generate a dev assistant for this repository”
- “Show me all TODOs in this project”

---

### Planned Enhancements

- Execute dev tools or scripts (e.g., run `npm test`)
- Reference relevant `DevNotes` for more accurate replies
- Auto-inject metadata about open PRs, commits, or issues
