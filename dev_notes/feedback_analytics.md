## Feedback Analytics System

This file outlines the structure, purpose, and implementation of the AI Assistant Platform's feedback analytics system, used to evaluate assistant performance and guide improvements.

---

### Purpose

- Track thumbs-up / thumbs-down feedback from users
- Analyze assistant effectiveness by **intent**
- Detect frequent fallback triggers and correction patterns

---

### Core Features

- MongoDB schema: `FeedbackLog`
  - Fields: `message`, `intent`, `rating`, `confidence`, `sessionId`, `timestamp`
- Admin dashboard to display analytics in tabular format
- Aggregation by:
  - Intent category
  - Rating (up/down)
  - Time range (default: last 30 days)
- Links to:
  - Correction system
  - Fallback logging
  - Admin review workflows

---

### Technical Implementation

- API: `GET /api/feedback/analytics`
- Aggregates feedback entries via MongoDB pipeline
- Frontend displays:
  - % helpful vs. unhelpful by intent
  - Total feedback volume
  - Summary table for active review

---

### Future Improvements

- Include assistant version and prompt history in logs
- Correlate fallback events with feedback entries
- Add alerting system for low-rated patterns
- Enable session deep dives for training refinement
